NOTE: This project is currently a work-in-progress. Not all features have been implemented and all code may be subject to change.

--------Graphic UI Instructions--------

To run the Graphical User Interface (GUI), run the file classes/DSC_GUI_APP.mlapp or type Run_DSC_GUI in the MATLAB command window.


--------Command-Line UI Instructions--------

Note: The CUI is not yet full implemented. It is recommended that you use the GUI for any and all testing or experiments.

To run the Command-Line User Interface (CUI), type Run_DSC_CUI in the MATLAB command window

To run an experiment with the CUI,
type "start daq box" to start the daq box sessions,
then type "start experiment" to start the experiment.

The program will allow you to save the data to an Excel file when the experiment is complete
